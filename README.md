# Mittleider Gardening Plus
The Mittleider Gardening Plus (MGP) git repository contains documents that build on or amend the 
Mittleider Gardening method as found in the current revision of the Mittleider Gardening Course book.


If you are getting started in the Mittleider Gardening method, look at the getting started guide 
(getting_started.md) and get a copy of the Mittleider Gardening course book.  If you are already 
familiar with the Mittleider Method, take a look at some of the amendments here and evaluate them 
for your situation.
