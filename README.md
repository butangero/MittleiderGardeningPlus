# Mittleider Gardening Plus
The Mittleider Gardening Plus (MGP) git repository contains documents that build-on or ammend the 
Mittleider Gardening method as found in the current revision of the Mittleider Gardening Course book.


If you are getting started in the Mittleider Gardening method, look at the getting started guide and get 
a copy of the Mittleider Gardening course book.  If you are already familiar with the Mittleider Method, 
take a look at some of the ammendments here and evaulate them for your situation.
