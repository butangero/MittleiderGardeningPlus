#Getting Started

## Genisis
The Mittleider method of gardening was designed by Honorary Dr. Jacob Mittleider.  It aims to 
provide an affordable  and general gardening system that both simplifies effort but also 
covers a wide variety of plants.  More details of his method can be found in the Mittleider 
Gardening Course book found at http://growfood.com.  This document is a condensed primer and
is not intended as a replacement for the course book.  That said, Mittleider Gardening Plus
(MGP) differs from the course book in how water is considered (namely PH), the growing medium 
and in the Weekly Feed composition.

##Key Concepts
- Laws of plant growth
- Plant medium
- Weekly feed
- Maximize space

##Laws of plant growth

###Light
Plants need light.  Different plants need different amounts.  Understand your plant's needs 
and design your garden accordingly.  For example, put talling plants that need more sun 
facing the sun.  Partial sun plants can be shaded a bit by the taller ones.  Shorter plants
that need full sun in front of the taller ones facing the sun.


During the seedling stage, get light to the seedling as soon as it pops.

###Temperature
You can grow any plant anywhere as long as you understand its light and temperature 
requirements.  The course book provides some tricks to extend your growing with the use of
in-the-garden greenhouses and provides a seedhouse and full greenhoues design.

###Water
Plants absorb nutrients in the water.  Water is also essential for photosythesis.  The PH 
of your water matters.  Plants cannot uptake nutrients if your PH is too high.  PH is 
especially important during the seedling phase.

Absorbtion happens in the roots, so that's the place where watering is recommended.
Watering leaves and other parts of the plant can introduce disease or infection and can 
evaporate before reaching the leaves.

The course book outlines a method of watering just inches above the soil using PVC pipe
with very small holes.  This method requires pressure to work.

###Nutrition
The most important nutrients are Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (P).  There 
are several other nutrients that plants need.  The Mittleider method suggests that soil be 
ammended if possible to include all the nutrients the plant needs.  The ammendment process 
is done weekly and is called the "Weekly Feed".

###Competition
Plants will compete with each other for sunlight and nutrients.  Plant spacing within the 
garden is designed in the Mittleider method to keep plants from competing too much with each 
other.  The course book has a chart that lists a number of common plants and how they should 
be spaced.

Weeds can also be an issue.  The Mittleider method suggests a plant medium helps with that 
because it is weed-free to begin with.  The course book has other methods of weed control in 
addition.

##Plant Medium

Mittleider Gardening Plus differs from the course book in the medium used.  MGP recommends a
PH corrected soil medium found here:

Raised beds are recommended but not required.  The Method contains instructions on how to do 
traditional rows and raised beds.

##Weekly Feed
Weekly Feed can work with any plant medium and is applied, as the name suggests, weekly.
MGP differs from the course book due to the fact that the current revision of the course 
book lacks water-soluable calcium.  Calcium is essential for the uptake and mobility of 
other nutrients so a whole number of deficiencies can result if calcium isn't found in a 
water soluable form.

The recipe can be found here:

##Maximizing space
In order to get the most out of available land and to avoid competition among plants, the 
Mittleider method suggests building T-frames and growing vine plants (like melons and 
tomatoes) vertically up a trelis system.  The T-frames allow proper spacing as plants are 
staggared where every other plant in the row/bed grows away from the plant next to it in a 
"V"-shape.

The construction instructions of the T-frames is in the course book.
