##Preventing and correcting nutrient deficiencies in your garden

**By Mark Taylor

A productive garden starts with the soil. It is rare that our backyards are light rich soils packed with organic matter and fully garden ready. We usually get stuck with sand, clay, and rock. In most cases we find ourselves amending the soil with a variety of methods.
Keeping in mind that PH is a tremendous concern, we should test the growing medium we are using be it dirt in our backyard, or a custom mix we are placing in raised beds or some type of container. 
The combination of one part peat moss, one part coco coir, and two parts perlite is used in many hydroponic setups and by Universities as they study plant growth. The PH of this mix is between 5.5 and 6.5 and it eliminates the need to use PH balancing materials (lime, gypsum, nitrates, etc.) that can throw off the feeding schedules that they use.
Regardless as to the growing medium you use, it is a fair bet you are going to need added nutrients. If you go with a raised bed with saw dust, peat moss, sand, perlite, coco coir and so on, adding nutrients will be essential. As a matter of efficiency, cost, ease of use, and overall practicality, I will discuss the use of inorganic fertilizers.
Dating back to 1865, the use of inorganic fertilizers was found to be very helpful in maintaining adequate levels of nutrients in the soil for crop growth. In 1940, Hoagland and Arnon revised an earlier formula to include every known nutrient required for plant growth. Today there exists many variations of this formula that target specific plants or a general application suitable for a wide variety of plants.
Regarding the specific formula of fertilizers, all are required to be listed by percentage of overall weight. Most common are NPK fertilizers that contain only the suggested nutrients nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.
As an example, a 25 pound bag of 13-13-13 fertilizer will contain 13% of each nutrient by weight so there will be 3.25 pounds each N, P, and K totaling 9.75 pounds of usable nutrients in the bag. The remaining 15.25 pounds consists of completely inert fillers or binding agents.
This type of general NPK fertilizer is void of the 10 other nutrients that are required for plant growth and 2 others (Na and Co) found to be useful. The complete formula for nutrients as required by law in all States is as follows, listing the 3 primary nutrients first, the 3 secondary nutrients, and finally the micro-nutrients.
N - P - K - Ca - Mg - S - B - Cl - Co - Cu - Fe - Mn - Mo - Na - Zn
These nutrients should always appear in the above order and by percentage of total weight on every fertilizer product you purchase. Only the nutrients that exist in a given formula will be listed. This is referred to as the “Guaranteed Analysis” and one example could be, N 13% - P 13% - K 13% - Ca 9%. This formula of course falls well short of containing all of the essential nutrients for plants.
Because the complexity of many solutions developed over the years by Scientists, we will look at formulas that are much easier to understand and prepare. We will start with a formula that was used by Jacob Mittleider with great success in many difficult regions across the globe. To begin, this is the actual formula for his “Weekly Feed” as it would be listed in a Guaranteed Analysis.
N 9.4% - P 3% - K 11% - Ca 7% - Mg 2.2% - S 3% 
B 0.11% - Cu 0.04% - Fe 0.62% - Mn 0.10% - Mo 0.035% - Zn 0.07%

To achieve this formula, Mittleider used a variety of easy to access fertilizers, common household items, and a few sulfate compounds likely acquired through chemical companies. The materials used and weights thereof are as follows.

9 lbs Calcium Nitrate
4 lbs Ammonium Nitrate 
1 and ½ lbs Diammonium phosphate
4 and ½ lbs Potassium sulfate or chloride
6 lbs Epsom salt
12 grams borax
*8 oz iron sulfate 
*4 grams copper sulfate
*8 grams zinc sulfate
*12 grams Manganese sulfate
*4 grams molybdenum sulfate

Mittleider's formula is a fair representation of the 1966 Hewitt Nutrient Solution, which in turn, is just another variation of the 1940 Hoagland Solution. It is noted in Mittleider's books that he experimented either with the quantities used, or the application rates thereof to minimize overall use and expense. Mittleider's application rate is 20 ounces for a 5'x30' grow box once a week. For those using other dimensions as grow areas, this simply equates to 3.77 grams per square foot each week.
Now lets make life as simple as possible and look at one more example used by Mittleider. 
Knowing that there would be times or areas where the above ingredients might not be available, Jacob introduced the “Mittleider Weekly Feeding Formula No. 2” as listed below.
11 ½ pounds 8-14-12 fertilizer
6 ¾ pounds ammonium nitrate
2 ¼ pounds potassium sulfate or chloride
2 ¼ pounds Epsom salt 
8 grams borax

Well this is still a little more than what we might want to deal with today because of the added trouble of acquiring the ammonium nitrate and potassium sulfate or chloride. Since there is a much wider variety of the NPK mixes available today, we can simply convert these two components by weight and add them to the 8-14-12 fertilizer. Converted, the NPK mix is now 15-7-18 simply add 2 ¼ pounds of epsom salt and 8 grams of borax and your good to go.....or not.
Mittleider warned that this secondary mix should be used only if the components of the original recipe were not available.... and for good reason. Not all of the required nutrients are in this simplified mix. In particular, a soluble form of calcium is absent. One might argue that the added lime or gypsum in Mittlieder's preplant mix would provide the needed calcium but this is not true. Lime and gypsum are insoluble in water and therefore are not immediately available to plants. It can be months and even years before these break down into a soluble form in soil or custom mixed planting mediums. Looking at Mittleider's original formula, it is clear that a water soluble form of calcium was included through the use of Calcium nitrate.
The omission of a soluble form of calcium must be corrected when using such a simple mix as mentioned. While we are at it, we may as well compensate for other needs. Many scientific studies have shown that all crops produce a much higher yield when rates of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S are increased above the levels found in the Hoagland, Hewitt, and yes, Mittleider's recipe. So let's kick it up.
To start with, many crops you will plant in your garden use a higher rate of phosphorous than others so we will compensate for this by using a more evenly prepared NPK product. By simply using a 16-16-16 mix we will be supplying the added P that peas, asparagus, corn, potato, sweet potato, onion, garlic, and many others require to produce higher yields. All we need now is some Mg, S, Ca, and little bit of B…..all completely water soluble of course. Toss in 6 pounds of Epsom salt, (that takes care of the Mg and S) 12 grams of Borax, (Boron) and 2 ½ pounds of Calcium Chloride (the water soluble Ca) and we have a simple yet very effective recipe below.

25 pounds 16-16-16 NPK product 
6 pounds Epsom Salt
12 grams Borax
2 ½ pounds Calcium Chloride

Application Rate when mixed evenly, 4 grams per square foot of planting area.
You might notice (given the application rate above coupled with the increased levels of NPK and Ca) that this mix looks to be 15% - 20% stronger in some ways and even double in others compared to Mittleider's original recipe and application rate. Well all I can say (in the immortal words of Austin Powers) is ......”Yea Baby”
So the next step is to simply toss all of this stuff into a bucket, mix well and use as needed right? Not so fast, life in the garden isn't that easy. Mixing all of these products together can cause some definite problems. To begin with, Epsom salt contains quite a bit of 7H2O that when exposed to humid air, tends to reorganize into it's favored form....water. In doing so, this water will come into contact with the NPK products and the calcium chloride. This begins the process of breaking down the components and mixing them together. The result is a watery mess at bottom and a brick like substance sitting in the middle of it.
What has happened? To begin with, a great deal of the actual NPK suspended in the binding agent and fillers of the NPK product has been released and is now concentrated in the watery muck below. As you may have noticed (having likely mixed similar batches yourself) it has quite a strong smell. This is a portion of the actual nutrients (N,P,K,Ca,Mg and S) that have volatilized into the atmosphere within the closed bucket. It now escapes and stinks to high heaven as you remove the lid.
Not realizing that the watery mess below is a highly concentrated mix of nutrients, the tendency might be to pour it off and crush the remaining brick like clump with a sledge hammer and use it as directed. Well now you have a very diluted mix of binding agents and fillers. Not great for a hungry plant to say the least. The daring might attempt to crush the brick like structure into the watery muck and then use it. However, it is now nearly impossible to imagine at what concentration we are feeding our plants any given nutrient. Then there is the “precipitation” thing going on now. Because calcium is present in the water based solution, some of the N,P,K, Mg, and S components have become insoluble and are now (for all intents and purposes in our garden) completely useless. In an effort to not simply waste it or create problems by tossing it in the trash, we may as well add 500 gallons of water and go service every lawn in sight with the stuff.
So life is just a little tougher in the garden. We need to mix these materials as we use them, in specific weights for a given area. Oh great ;( ...more calculations.
In a container of it's own, we will add the Borax to the Epsom salt.... 6 pounds 12 grams in weight now.

2 ½ pounds of Calcium Chloride in its own container. 
25 pounds 16-16-16 in a bag
For each square foot of grow area mix: 
3 grams 16-16-16
0.7 grams Epsom/Borax
0.3 grams Calcium Chloride

For a standard Mittleider 18”x 30' ….45 sq foot bed, mix:

135 grams 16-16-16
31 grams Epsom/Borax
13 grams calcium chloride

Did I just hear some say, “what about the micro-nutrients? Well, scroll back up to the Mittleider “Weekly Feed” recipe. Note that there are asterisks beside 5 of the ingredients. These asterisks appeared in his books as shown. With the explanation, “use only if needed, not usually needed for the first 3 or 4 years of heavy crop removal” This is based on the assumption that your beds sit atop natural soil and that the roots of your crops will be able to access the soil below.
Hmm, I guess there has been quite an amount of “Magic Mix” spread about over the years ….. in a fairly wasteful and costly manner to say the least. Given the dishonesty surrounding the need to add micro-nutrients in most cases and the inability to recognize missing components, I would advise that one avoid purchasing materials from such manufacturers.
You will need these micro-nutrients eventually and in some cases, like if you are growing in containers or in a straight hydroponic setup you will need to add them right away. Finding a reliable source that provides a correctly prepared mix may be a little tough..... but it will be found.
So the above mix is the preventative part of avoiding nutrient deficiencies in your garden. Providing EVERYTHING your plants need in adequate quantities. Correcting any need for added nutrients is as simple as feeding your plants the same formula twice a week for 2 weeks.
